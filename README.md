# PredictTheRoadSign
This project predicts the road sign facing sensor taking measurements.

Dataset provided here has details on camera sign was detected, Angle of sign with respect to front in degrees, Sign's reported bounding box aspect ratio (width/height), Sign Width and Height, and the target feature Sign Facing, which is where the sign is actually facing.

Goal here is to predict where the sign is actually facing with respect to the vehicle, given above set of inputs.
